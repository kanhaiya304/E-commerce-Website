## Introduction

This E-commerce website is a demonstration of my skills in Angular development. The project was created as part of an internship, and it includes all the essential features of an online store, such as product listings, a shopping cart, user authentication, and order processing. The website is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Product Listings**: Dynamic display of products with filtering and sorting options.
- **Product Details**: Detailed view of each product with images, descriptions, and reviews.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update items in the cart.
- **Order Processing**: Checkout process with order summary and confirmation.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout for an optimal user experience on all devices.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage products, categories, and orders.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ecommerce-website
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up the environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration settings (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   ng serve
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

Once the application is set up, you can start exploring its features:

1. **Browse Products**: View and search for products.
2. **View Product Details**: Click on a product to see more details.
3. **Add to Cart**: Add products to your shopping cart.
4. **Checkout**: Proceed to checkout and place an order.

## Configuration

To configure the application, modify the environment-specific settings in the `src/environments` folder:

- `environment.ts` for development
- `environment.prod.ts` for production

You can set API endpoints, database URLs, and other configurations in these files.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots of your project to showcase its features and design.
